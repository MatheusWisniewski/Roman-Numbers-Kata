# Roman-Numbers-Kata

Kata suggested in "The Coding Dojo handbook"
-----

**Part 1**

> For this Kata, write a function to convert from normal (Arabic) numbers to Roman Numerals:

> | Arabic | Roman |
> | :---: | :---: |
> | 1 | **I** |
> | 10 | **X** |
> | 7 | **VII** |

> etc.

> There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than
about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any
higher).

**Part 2**

> Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral
to digit

> | Roman | Arabic |
> | :---: | :---: |
> | L | **50** |
> | IV | **4** |
> | MMXVII | **2016** |

> etc.

- **Build tests that run through the entire application.**
